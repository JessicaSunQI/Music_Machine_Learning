# Machine Learning for Music Analysis

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on analyzing and predicting music-related patterns using **data-driven techniques**. The project utilizes a dataset of musical features and applies machine learning models to extract insights.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to apply machine learning techniques to music-related data to identify trends, classify genres, or predict characteristics of songs. The main components of this repository include a **Jupyter Notebook** for analysis and a **dataset** containing relevant musical attributes.





## Data

- **MusicData.csv**: A structured dataset containing numerical and categorical features representing various aspects of music (e.g., tempo, loudness, key, mode, genre, etc.).
- The dataset is processed and analyzed in `Machine_L_Music.ipynb`.

## Models and Analysis

The Jupyter Notebook includes:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, normalization, and feature engineering.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualization and statistical insights.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implementation of classification or regression models for music analysis.
- **Model Evaluation**: Performance metrics and tuning strategies.

## Installation and Usage

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have **Python 3.7+** installed along with Jupyter Notebook.

### Install Dependencies

You can install the required dependencies using:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
